	    <h3>Yosemite</h3>
	    <ul class="facts" id="list-1">
		    <li>Yosemite is revered as the birth place of rock climbing for sport.</li>
		    <li>Yosemite welcomes over 4 million visitors each year, with the majority in July and August. It is the third most popular National Park in terms of number of annual                        visitors.</li>
		    <li>Yosemite National Park is home to one of the most popular waterfalls in the world.</li>
		    <li>Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3>Yellowstone</h3>
	    <ul class="facts" id="list-2">
		    <li>Yellowstone is the world's first national park.</li>
		    <li>Yellowstone is larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.</li>
		    <li>Two threatened species call Yellowstone home - Canada lynx and Grizzly bears. Wolverines are a proposed threatened species.</li>
		    <li>Yellowstone has 1000 to 3000 earthquakes annually.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3>Death Valley</h3>
	    <ul class="facts" id="list-3">
		    <li>Humans made their mark in Death Valley at least 9,000 years ago, with rock art and other artifacts left behind as evidence.</li>
		    <li>Despite it's foreboding name, Death Valley is home to bighorn sheep, reptiles, lizards, snakes, amphibians plus more than 300 species of birds, not to mention the                        explosion of fauna that erupt after a rainfall.</li>
		    <li>Dozens of scenes from Star Wars have been filmed in Death Valley, including Artist's Palette (the Sandcrawler scene from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), Golden Canyon                 (Jawa scenes from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) and Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes (Droid scenes from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). </li>
		    <li>Scientists can't agree how old Ubehebe Crater is. Initial research believed it's between 2,000 to 7,000 years old, but new findings peg it at 800 years old. But everyone                 agree it's huge - half a mile wide and 500 to 777 feet deep.</li>
